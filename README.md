# Phase 3 Project 

#Bio
- I finished my phase 3 software development project at Flatiron School this week! 
- I built a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, 
- and a separate React frontend that interacts with that database via the API. 
- After comparing my phase 3 project with my phase 1 project, I realized just how important object-oriented programming is.

## Learning CRUD

- **Create** a new todo
- **Read** a list of all todos
- **Update** an individual todo
- **Delete** a todo

For this project, you must:

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.



You can start your server with:

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
